                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: How Do I List My Property with the Section 8 Program?</strong><br />
                    A: Landlords are able to submit their listing of an available unit by completing the Section 8 Property Listing Form  The property list is updated on the 1st and 15th of each month. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Who qualifies and picks my tenant?</strong><br />
                    A: You must do your own tenant screening and test for suitability..
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: How Much Can I Rent My Unit For?</strong><br /> 
                    A: The JHA has Payment Standards by bedroom size that are guidelines for determining the maximum subsidy we can pay for a family. This Payment Standard is generally a gauge of the current rental market. However, each unit is evaluated by the Inspector on a case-by-case basis. Each unit's rent must be reasonable and comparable to unassisted private market rental units of similar size, location, amenities, quality, unit type, maintenance, utilities and services. Current Payment Standards can be accessed from the JHA Web Site.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Who Pays the Security Deposit?</strong><br /> 
                    A: All tenants are responsible for their own Security Deposit pursuant to State and local laws.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: What Happens After I Find A Tenant?</strong><br /> 
                    A: Once you have identified an acceptable Section 8 Participant, complete the Request For Tenancy Approval (R4TA) form & package that the tenant provides you with. Once that document is received in our office, a Housing Inspector will contact you to schedule an inspection of the unit. The lease may begin once the inspection is completed with a “passed” status.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: What Will The Inspector Be Looking For?</strong><br /> 
                    A: The Housing Inspector will be checking to see whether the unit is in compliance with Housing Quality Standards (HQS). These are minimum standards that any unit rented under the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program must meet. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Can I Use My Own Lease?</strong><br /> 
                    A: You are free to use your own lease. However, HUD regulations require that the HUD Tenancy Addendum be attached to an owner provided lease. If the owner's lease contradicts anything in the HUD Tenancy Addendum, the HUD addendum shall prevail.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: When Can I Expect My First Check?</strong><br /> 
                    A: After we have executed the Lease and Housing Assistance Payments Contract and the owner has provided the JHA with proof of legal ownership, the contract is processed for payment. Generally, the first check takes approximately two weeks. After the first payment is generated, subsequent checks are sent on the first of each month.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Who Do I Call If I have a Question or Problem With The Tenancy?</strong><br /> 
                    A: Each tenant is assigned a Housing Eligibility Analyst. The Eligibility Analyst handles any matters concerning the family's income or household composition and payments.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Is My Unit Inspected After The Initial Inspection?</strong><br /> 
                    A: Yes. The JHA must inspect all participant units annually. This is generally done near the contract anniversary date. In addition, in the case of an emergency or complaint by the owner or tenant, a special inspection will be done.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: Can I Cancel the JHA Contract If I'm Not Satisfied?</strong><br /> 
                    A: No. Only the JHA can cancel the Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract. An owner is free to terminate a lease agreement pursuant to the terms of the lease and applicable Florida law. Once the Lease agreement ends, the HAP Contract terminates automatically. In the case of malfeasance by the tenant, the owner is free to initiate eviction proceedings.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <strong>Q: How Long Can I Rent To A Section 8 Family?</strong><br /> 
                    A: The initial lease term is for one year. After the initial term, the lease continues on a month-to-month basis indefinitely so long as HUD continues to provide the appropriations needed to fund the Section 8 Program.
